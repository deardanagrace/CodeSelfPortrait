## Code Self Portrait
#### by Dana Capistrano



### Overview
A self portrait of myself, Dana, made entirely with p5.js shapes and functions!


### Technical Details

*take your hand drawn portrait and reinterpret it using just P5.js drawing functions. No drawing in Illustrator, scanning in images. This should all be procedural code.*
